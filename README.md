# Project-H
This is a Refactor of an existing project. 
The final product should look like the following image.
 

The main goal was to recude redundancy in the code as well make sure the site is acessable to those to may use adaptive technology such as a screen reader.
I cleaned and orginize the existing sections while condencing down some of the repetive CSS code.
I added notations to explain my work and the existing sections as well as any changes I made.
