The main goal was to recude redundancy in the code as well make sure the site is acessable to those to may use adaptive technology such as a screen reader.
I cleaned and orginize the existing sections while condencing down some of the repetive CSS code.
I added notations to explain my work and the existing sections as well as any changes I made.
